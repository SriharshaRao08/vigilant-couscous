            Dosa
        </div>
        <p>
            Dosa or Dhosai is a fermented crepe or pancake made from rice batter and black lentils.It is indigenous to and is a staple dish in the southern Indian states of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu, as well as being popular in Sri Lanka. Dosa is also popular in Malaysia and Singapore,where the name Thosai is more commonand in Myanmar as Toshay.

The origins of Dosa have been widely discussed in literature and books. A few of them are listed below:

* A reference to Dosa occurs in the Tamil Sangam Literature from around 6th century AD.Edward Farnworth mentions the first reference to Dosa in Tamil Sangam literature in the sixth century A.D.
* The Sanskrit classic Manasollasa written in 1051 AD by Western Chalukya king Somesvara III describes Dosai.
* Modern writers have conflicting views on the origin of Dosa. The English food writer Pat Chapman and Lisa Rayner as well as Indian writer Thangappan Nair state in their works that Dosa originated in Udupi, Karnataka.

It is a common breakfast dish, and street food.The dosa is rich in carbohydrates, contains no salt, sugar or saturated fats and its constituent ingredients of rice and lentils mean that it is glutton-free and contains protein.The fermentation process increases the vitamin B and vitamin C content.There are also instant mix products for making dosa, with somewhat lower nutritional benefits.

        </div>
        <p>

            Hugely popular throughout the Indian subcontinent, Bangladeshi biryani is often considered the best in the world.

            In the Bengali region, popular meats include mutton, goat, chicken and beef, but there is such a wide variety of biryani dishes available that you can try.

            A true traditional biryani involves different types of cooking and preparation, as marinated meat is layered with rice, potatoes and spices, the dish is jam packed with flavour.

        <p>
            Idli along with its side servings is one of the best and balanced nutrition for breakfast or any day of the meal. The side servings coconut chutney, sambar and milakai podi provide more essential nutrients to the body. Let us start with plain idly without considering side servings.

Idly is made is from par boiled rice, which is a bit more nutritious than raw rice by having higher amount of protein, fibre, vitamins and minerals. Urad dal used to make the batter has high amount of fibre, about 26% of protein and rich in Vitamin B1/B2/B6 and few minerals. B6 will be lost if the dal used is processed dal i.e. skin removed kernel. It is best to remove the skin before preparing for the batter, just like the olden days. Fermentation process brings in good bacteria to the batter.

Consider the side servings. Coconut has high amount of fibre and so is the chick peas. Chick peas also is a good source of protein apart from fibre. Green chilly is one of the highest sources of Vitamin C. Coconut, chick peas and chillies combined to give one of the best source of fibre, protein, vitamin C and minerals. Add few curry leaves for garnishing. Your day's supply for Vitamin A is also covered. So Idly combined with chutney provides all necessary vitamins except Vitamins E & B12. We will come to the remaining vitamins.
